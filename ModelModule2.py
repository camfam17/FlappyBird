# Model class extends nn.Module
# Takes init arguments like fitness_function and network

# Selection functions


# Fitness functions


# Models
# This is where the selection of models will go. 
# They will be dictionaries:
# when an exeriment is run and the list of agents is created you will create a new model in that for loop with these dictionaries (deepcopied?) as arguments
# This should create completely separate instances of models (class) and their networks (variable)


# Create an experiment class that takes arguments like model, selection_functions, fitness_functions, generations, population size etc that will run an experiment and save the results.
